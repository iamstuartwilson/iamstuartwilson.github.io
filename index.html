# Bonjour!

Hello curious person, welcome to HTML for my site/CV.
As you can see, there's not an awful lot going on, but le me explain why...

You see, the internet is a vast place and people spend a lot of time on it
with the sole aim of simply obtaining information.  That said I decided
to ensure that anyone on this website could find the information they need as
quickly as possible so there are no images, there's no JavaScript,
no webfonts, minimal CSS and no back end!

    </h3>
    <p>At Catch I’ve been instrumental in driving the tech credentials of the agency forward through the applied introduction of modern web technologies and standards. After joining as a Front End Developer I was quickly promoted to Head of Front End Development, where I have been responsible for mentoring other developers, driving change and unifying our approach to reduce internal technical hurdles and drive development phases at a quicker pace.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Whilst at graze.com I was involved in rewriting and implementing the Pistachio pattern library as part of a team whilst modernising the website’s JavaScript using CommonJS modules and Browserify. My day to day duties included developing the website UI to support commercial projects whilst focusing on code modularity, reuse and scalability in an agile team of software developers.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Joining eight&amp;four as a Junior Developer, I moved quickly within the agency to establish myself as the Lead Developer. Heading up the technical output of the agency, my main responsibilities included developing, testing and deploying primarily WordPress built websites. Other responsibilities as the senior developer on the team involved scoping out new projects with clients, writing technical specifications and bringing technical innovation to the agency.</p>
