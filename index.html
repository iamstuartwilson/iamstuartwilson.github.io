    </h3>
    <p>At NearForm I’ve had the privilege to work across open and inner source projects to help push the company’s ability to deliver industry leading React and Node.js solutions.</p>

    <p>For 2.5 years I worked at TELUS, scaling their existing commerce flows to increase their ecommerce offering. Within my role, I worked closely with the UX designers to develop complex experiences which could scale across products and teams.</p>

    <p>Currently I’m developing complex editing features for a global consultancy firm as part of one of their well established cloud products.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>At Catch I was instrumental in driving the tech credentials of the agency forward through the applied introduction of modern web technologies and standards. After joining as a Front End Developer I was quickly promoted to Head of Front End Development, where I was responsible for mentoring other developers, driving change and unifying our approach, to reduce internal technical hurdles and drive development phases at a quicker pace.</p>
